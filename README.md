## Surfd
Surfd is an executable bash script that runs the suckless surf browser on a predefined url (duckduck) and delete the
cookies after the execution.
It should be put in the $PATH to launch it as a standalone cli application instead of an alias
The browser is compiled with several settings in his config.h that manage cookie policies, dark mode and such, so no
flag are needed
